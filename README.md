Voice assistants have become increasingly popular due to the global pandemic, making them an integral part of modern smart devices. The Next Gen Optimal Voice Assistant (NOVA) aims to bridge the gap between commercial and personalised voice assistants by providing a simple yet effective solution for essential tasks. NOVA is designed to operate on personal desktops and laptops, ensuring compatibility and ease of access without expensive hardware or internet connectivity. Python programming and libraries like speech recognition, pyttsx3, Wikipedia, web browser, and Wolfram Alpha enhance NOVA's functionality and provide real-time information to users. The project demonstrates how voice-enabled technology can be developed and deployed in academic or personal contexts, showcasing the intersection of AI, human-computer interaction, and system automation. Advantages of NOVA include enhanced accessibility, time efficiency, multifunctional capabilities, customisation and extensibility, offline functionality, low cost and open source, natural language interaction, educational and developmental use, and platform independence for development.
